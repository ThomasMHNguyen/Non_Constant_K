# Description
This directory contains the code need to perform linear stability analysis for a filament placed at the origin in extensional flow. Additionally, it will calculate the linear and adjoint eigenfunctions associated with each stiffness profile.

## Contents

### Calculations

1. Calculate the growth rates (eigenvalues) and shapes (eigenfunctions) related to linear stability analysis for a filament placed at the origin in extensional flow for each stiffness profile. Export the mode number associated with each shape and growth rate to a .CSV file.

2. Calculate the flow strength values \\(\bar{\mu}\\) at the onset of instability \\(\sigma = 0\\) for each stiffness profile.

3. Calculate the adjoint operator to the linear operator from linear stability analysis. 

### Post-processing/Analysis

1. Plot the filament shapes between the different stiffness profiles at various \\(\bar{\mu}\\) values.

2. Plot the eigenspectrum maps that show the growth rate $\sigma$ for each mode number as a function of \\(\bar{\mu}\\).
