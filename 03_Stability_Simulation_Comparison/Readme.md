# Description
This directory contains the code need to compare the Brownian simulation results with linear stability analysis. This directory also contains files to generate the plots. 

## Contents

### Calculations

1. Calculate the amplitude of each mode shape for all ensembles and determine the percentage of most dominant modes based on these values for all stiffness profiles. 

### Post-processing/Analysis

1. Plot the percentage of most dominant modes for each stiffness profile on stacked area plots. 

2. Determine the most dominant mode at specific \\(\bar{\mu}\\) values in the Brownian simulations and compare it to the predicted dominant mode from linear stability analysis. 

3. Plot the average amplitude values as a function of time and compare the amplitude growth curves between different \\(\ell_{p}/L\\) values (Not used for the paper).
