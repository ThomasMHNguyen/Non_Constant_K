# Description
This directory contains all of the code needed to run the slender-body simulations as well as some basic analysis code. 

## Contents

### Simulations

1. Non-Brownian Simulations in shear/extensional flow

2. Brownian simulations for extensional flow

### Post-processing/Analysis

1. Elastic Energy $E_{elastic} = 1/2 \displaystyle \int^{L/2}_{-L/2}{B(s)\mathbf{x}_{ss}\: ds}$

2. Filament Compression $L_{ee}^{*} = 1 - L_{ee}/L$ where $L_{ee}^{*}$ is the compression amount, $L_{ee}$ is the end-to-end distance of the filament, and $L$ is the filament length.

3. Particle extra stress tensor $\mathbf{\sigma} = \displaystyle \int^{L/2}_{-L/2}{\mathbf{f}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{x}\mathbf{f}\: ds}$

4. Filament shapes and tension profiles at various time points during the analysis
